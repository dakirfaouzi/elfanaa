/**
 * Catalog types — fanaa-local mirror of the persistence-layer row shape.
 *
 * # Why mirror instead of import from `@platform/persistence`
 *
 * `packages/persistence/src/contracts.ts` already establishes the
 * pattern of re-typing Prisma rows locally so each consumer is
 * independent of Prisma codegen (`prisma generate` doesn't have to
 * have run for `tsc` to pass). We do the same thing here:
 *
 *   • Keeps fanaa's workspace install graph unchanged (no new
 *     `@platform/persistence` dependency just for one type).
 *   • Lets fanaa's typecheck pass even when `prisma generate` hasn't
 *     produced the `@prisma/client` types yet (the same fallback the
 *     Docker `postinstall || echo` block relies on).
 *   • The shape is small and stable — fields here MUST stay in lock-step
 *     with `StorefrontCatalogProductRow` in
 *     `packages/persistence/src/contracts.ts`. The seed CLI is the
 *     contract test: if this mirror drifts, the curated seed payload
 *     won't deserialise and the auto-seed will surface a typed error
 *     at boot.
 *
 * # When to revisit
 *
 * Once `@platform/storefront-catalog` (or equivalent) exists as a
 * shared package that fanaa + studio both consume, swap this mirror
 * for a direct import. Until then, the mirror is the cheapest way to
 * keep persistence + storefront decoupled.
